  "info": "The Trace's <a href='https://twitter.com/BrianFreskos'>Brian Freskos</a> launched an enormous investigation into gun theft by requesting data on stolen and recovered guns from hundreds of law enforcement agencies around the country. I helped to clean and analyze that data, writing scripts to normalize hundreds of spelling variations, identify errors in serial numbers, and comb through the records to match stolen and recovered firearms. We <a href='https://www.thetrace.org/missing-pieces/'>partnered</a> with more than a dozen NBC stations, who used the data, as well as graphics I produced, to report on gun theft in cities around the country. We also <a href='https://www.thetrace.org/missing-pieces-data'>published the raw data</a>. This project was awarded Best Reporting by Independent Digital Media at the <a href='http://www.deadlineclub.org/2018-winners/'>2018 Deadline Club Awards</a>.",
