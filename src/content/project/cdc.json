  "info": "<a href='https://twitter.com/sean_kev'>Sean Campbell</a> and I teamed up with FiveThirtyEight's quantitative editor <a href='https://twitter.com/quantmai'>Mai Nguyen</a> to investigate the flawed approach used by the CDC to generate estimates of nonfatal firearm injuries. We developed a methodology for comparing the trends indicated by the CDC's data with those in other public health datasets, and found that the high degree of uncertainty around the CDC's estimates had serious implications for public health research in the United States. This article and its <a href='https://www.thetrace.org/2019/03/cdc-nonfatal-gun-injuries-update/'>follow-up</a> prompted a group of senators to <a href='https://www.thetrace.org/rounds/senators-cdc-gun-injuries-letter/'>demand answers</a> from the Secretary of Health and Human Services about the CDC's data quality issues.",
