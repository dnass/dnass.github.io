  "info": "Using a dataset provided by Gun Violence Archive, I built this interactive map of more than 150,000 shooting incidents spanning five years. To tackle the challenge of smoothly mapping that many points, I used the incredibly performant deck.gl library along with Mapbox, React, and Redux. A search feature shows users the number of shootings in their vicinity by linking the Mapbox geocoding API with Turf.js's geospatial analysis technologies. I did a <a href='https://blog.mapbox.com/visualizing-gun-violence-in-america-bb36021b3aae'>Q&A about this project</a> that was published on Mapbox's Points of Interest blog.",
