  "info": "With inflation dominating the headlines, I built this calculator to allow Canadians to see in depth how rising prices affect their own budgets. The project uses <a href=\"https://github.com/ShawONEX/global-news-interactive-data/actions/workflows/consumer-price-index.yaml\">GitHub Actions</a> to automatically <a href=\"https://github.com/ShawONEX/global-news-interactive-data/blob/main/consumer-price-index/scripts/cpi.R\">process</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/ShawONEX/global-news-interactive-data/tree/main/consumer-price-index/data\">publish</a> monthly inflation data releases from Statistics Canada. In the interactive app, built with Svelte, users can select a province and plug in numbers from their own budget to see how much their spending has increased over time.",
