  "info": "For a feature on NRA lobbyist Marion Hammer, I collaborated with The New Yorker's digital team to create an interactive map illustrating the NRA grades of every Florida lawmaker. I sourced the data from the NRA's <a href='https://www.nrapvf.org/grades/'>archive</a>, and built the map with D3. The graphic was published on The Trace and in The New Yorker's <a href='https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/05/the-nra-lobbyist-behind-floridas-pro-gun-policies'>version</a> of the article.",
