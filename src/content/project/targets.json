The first illustrates <a href='https://www.atf.gov/resource-center/firearms-trace-data-2017'>ATF crime gun traces</a> by connecting states with swoopy arrows, which were drawn with <a href='http://turfjs.org/'>Turf.js</a> and baked out to GeoJSON files. The second uses a scroll-driven flyover to explore the locations where several dozen stolen guns were recovered.",
