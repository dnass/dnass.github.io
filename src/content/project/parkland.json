  "info": "This project, which tells the stories of more than a thousand children killed by gun violence, was a huge collaboration between The Trace, The Miami Herald/McClatchy, and more than 200 student journalists, with a standalone website built by <a href='https://www.upstatement.com/'>Upstatement</a>. I worked closely with the Upstatement team and fellow Trace staff to conceive the design and functionality of the project site â€” my contributions included key features such as the category-driven navigation and star motifs. I also coordinated a team-wide push to prepare the site's content for production in Google Docs and AirTable.",
