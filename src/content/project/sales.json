To give readers a clearer picture of the trend, I built this gun sales explainer and database, using the raw FBI numbers to produce seasonally adjusted sales estimates at the national and state level. My analysis draws on the work of economist <a href='https://smallarmsanalytics.com/'>Jurgen Brauer</a>, as well as prior analyses by <a href='https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/nics-firearm-background-checks'>BuzzFeed News</a> and <a href='https://github.com/nytimes/gunsales'>The New York Times</a>. The project updates on a monthly basis as new data is released.",
