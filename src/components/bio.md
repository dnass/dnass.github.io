I’m an [award-winning](#awards-and-recognition) web developer and data journalist based in Toronto. I specialize in helping small newsrooms achieve big ambitions: building news apps and visual stories, and transforming editorial workflows with custom CMS tools.

I've been on staff at [The Investigative Journalism Foundation](https://theijf.org/author/daniel-nass), [Global News](https://globalnews.ca/author/daniel-nass), and [The Trace](https://thetrace.org/author/daniel-nass). My work has also been published in [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-local-correspondents/when-cars-kill-pedestrians), [USA TODAY](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2021/05/26/gun-dealers-let-off-hook-when-atf-inspections-find-violations/7210266002/), and [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/daniel-nass/).
